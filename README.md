# Flutter-toDoApp
A Flutter to-do app is a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework, which is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google.
The primary purpose of a to-do app is to help users manage their tasks and stay organized. In the context of Flutter, a to-do app is often used as a beginner's project to learn the basics of app development.

A typical Flutter to-do app allows users to:

View Tasks: Display a list of tasks that the user needs to complete.

Add Tasks: Provide a way for users to add new tasks to their to-do list.

Mark Tasks as Completed: Allow users to mark tasks as completed when they are done.

Delete Tasks: Provide the option to remove tasks that are no longer needed.

Edit Tasks: Allow users to modify task details, such as the task title or description.

Organize Tasks: Optionally, users might be able to categorize tasks, set due dates, or prioritize tasks.

Creating a to-do app in Flutter involves designing the user interface using Flutter widgets, managing the state of tasks using state management techniques, 
and implementing the logic to add, edit, and delete tasks. It's a practical way to learn about Flutter's UI components, handling user interactions, and basic app architecture.
